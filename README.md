### Example Strategy #1: DEX arbitrage

The **main** branch is likely to go through a lot of changes, so to run an example that runs without breaking,
you should switch to the **examples/strategy/dex_arb_base** branch before running **main.py**. Run:

```
git checkout examples/strategy/dex_arb_base
```
